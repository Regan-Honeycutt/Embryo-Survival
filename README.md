PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project is to statistically analyze and model the effect of elevated salinity on survival of southern toad embryos. The data for this project were collected during the summer of 2021. Toads were collected during amplexus, and oviposition occurred in the lab. After fertilization could be confirmed, the embryos were randomly assigned a treatment (control, 4ppt salinity, or 6ppt salinity) and placed in populations of 20 (for each treatment N=600). The decrease of population size for each population was recorded for a 7 day period. 

  The codebase for this project is in R, and the data are are in a .cvs format. The data includes the population size per day (1-7), the treatment (control, 4ppt, 6ppt), and the clutch identification. This analysis uses a Poisson Rgression model to quantify the impact of salinity level as well as a possible interaction effect between treatment and time. 



  I would like to thank Dr. Allison Welch for providing the opportunity and guidance to collect the data for this project, Dr. Dan McGlinn for the assistance with the code and patience with my limited statistics knowledge, and Aubrey Anthony for assistance in data collection.
